AUTHORS, LICENSE and TRADEMARK are files taken directly from libpng-1.6.37 source code.

I did not write any of them, they are only here for reference.

The other files are modified based on the original files present in libpng-1.6.37/projects/vstudio , I modified them to be able to compile smoothly with the nmake file.

I also didn't create those files, only modified them.

All credit goes to the libpng team at http://www.libpng.org/ , please go check it out for yourself.
